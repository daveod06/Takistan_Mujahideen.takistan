Remove all traces of Communist forces from Takistan. They severely outnumber
and outgun us, but this is <b>our</b> home. Ambush their supply lines;
raid their armories; show no mercy. ALLAHU AKBAR! 
Our Muslim brothers are streaming in from Dirkadirkastan to join the fight!

The situation should be pretty goddamned obvious. The Soviet scum moved in
to our home unannounced and uninvited, took control of <em>everything</em>.
It's time to remove them in the name of Allah!
